# sorting-visualizer

This is a website created using HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT
This helps us understand the implementation of our basic Sorting Algorithms, namely:-

    Bubble sort
    Selection sort
    Insertion sort
    Merge sort
    Quick sort
    Heap sort

Some of its cool features are:-

* We can view the time complexity and space complexity of each algorithm
* We can control the visualizations- 1)Size of Data 2)Speed of Visualization 3)Generation of New Data
* Colored representation of execution of each Step. 1) Blue:default 2) Yellow: Being compared 3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved 4) Green: In correct position
